Most teams waste time reviewing dependency update pull requests. Engineers spend hours each week checking if library updates will break their code. This process slows down development and creates backlogs of security patches.

There is a better way. Teams can automatically merge dependency updates when they have the right setup.

## The Problem with Manual Reviews

Dependabot and similar tools create pull requests when dependencies need updates. Teams then manually review each PR. This creates several problems:

- Engineers spend time on reviews that add little value
- Security patches get delayed for weeks or months
- Teams fall behind on bug fixes in dependencies
- The backlog of updates grows until it becomes overwhelming

Manual review makes sense when you cannot trust your automated tests. But what if you could trust them?

---

## The Solution: Automatic Merging

Instead of manually reviewing every dependency update, merge them automatically. Let your CI/CD pipeline decide if an update is safe.

This approach works when your pipeline can answer one question: "Is this change safe to deploy?" If your tests pass and your scans are clean, the update goes through without human intervention.

---

## What to line up before turning it on

| Area | Questions to ask | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Test coverage** | Do unit and integration tests exercise code paths that call external libraries? | Missing cases equal silent breakage. |
| **Security scanning** | Are SBOM, vulnerability and license checks part of the pipeline? | Stops merges that introduce risk. |
| **Performance gates** | Does the build fail on unexpected latency or memory jumps? | Stops “slow but correct” updates. |
| **Rollback** | Can the platform roll back fast on production errors? | Limits blast radius if a bad update slips through. |
| **Alerting** | Does the team get alerts on failed merges and post‑merge incidents? | Keeps trust in the hands‑off flow. |
| **Version rules** | Which updates can auto‑merge (patch, minor) and which still need humans (major)? | Lets teams phase in the practice. |

## Examples in the wild

- **GitHub** ― Many internal and open‑source repos use the marketplace action that auto‑merges Dependabot pull requests once tests pass. ([GitHub](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dependabot-auto-merge))
- **Spotify** ― Fleet‑management tooling sends out ~7,500 dependency changes per week; 75 % merge with no human in the loop. ([Spotify Engineering](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/4/spotifys-shift-to-a-fleet-first-mindset-part-1))
- **Netflix** ― Spinnaker pipelines promote new builds through environments, with automated canary analysis guarding the path. Pipelines run whenever a new version (including a library bump) is ready, giving fast and repeatable releases. ([Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/ebook/ContinuousDeliveryWithSpinnaker.pdf))

## Configuration Example

Most teams start with rules like these:

- Auto-merge patch updates for all dependencies
- Auto-merge minor updates for trusted dependencies
- Require manual review for major version changes
- Skip auto-merge for dependencies marked as high-risk
- Pause auto-merging during high-traffic periods

---

## When Not to Auto-Merge

Skip auto-merging if your project has:

- Limited test coverage
- No automated security scanning
- Manual deployment processes
- Insufficient monitoring
- High-stakes production environment with zero tolerance for downtime
- Dependencies that frequently introduce breaking changes

---

## Pros

- Security fixes land minutes after disclosure.
- Engineers spend review time on feature work, not boilerplate.
- The main branch always compiles, easing future upgrades.
- Smaller, continuous upgrades simplify root‑cause analysis when something breaks.

## Cons

- Weak or flaky tests block merges or, worse, allow regressions.
- Large frameworks that need manual smoke tests may still need reviewers.
- Build times grow because every update runs every check.
- Teams may assume safety and skip occasional deeper audits.

---

## The Bottom Line

Automated dependency pull requests already tell you whether they are safe—the checks are either green or red. Invest in broad tests, security gates and rollback paths; then hand the merge button to the bot and take the toil off your schedule.

Start small. Enable automatic merging for patch updates first. Expand to minor versions as confidence grows. Reserve manual review for major updates or critical dependencies.

The goal isn't to eliminate all human oversight. It's to focus human attention where it matters most: architectural decisions, security-critical changes, and complex updates that tests alone can't validate.

*Your dependencies will have vulnerabilities. The question is whether you'll patch them in hours or months.*
