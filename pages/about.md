I’m a product security engineer specializing in building exceptional security solutions. Currently, I’m focused on building dev-centric security products (using shift-left approach) at [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/in/en/).

I am also a [Certified Ethical Hacker (Practical)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNm0BA837_kds7ITUTGTjpvIyeq5j93R/view). I have a keen interest in cybersecurity and I am always eager to learn new things. I have experience in Product Security, Application Security, Security Automation, Python Scripting, DevSecOps, Cloud Security, Vulnerability Management, etc.

My goal is to continuously learn and apply new skills and technologies to protect and empower the digital world. I am passionate about cybersecurity and I love to share my knowledge with others. Here I am writing this blog as my hobby. I hope you like them. Besides these, I like to read books.
